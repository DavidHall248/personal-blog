####Bike Frame Bag

I got bunch of random scraps of tech/outdoor fabrics at a fabric sale recently, and decided to make a frame bag for the inside of my bike's frame. 

The first step was to cut out a cardboard template that fit inside the frame.

I used the template to cut out shapes from some thin plastic cutting boards I found to stiffen the bag.

I made the side panels out of a black ripstop, with an orange stripe across the top. One side has a zipper.

The inside has a thinner grey ripstop as a lining. To house the plastic pieces, I left a slot open along the top of the lining, and there is a second layer inside that will hold the plastic in place.

I added webbing straps at intervals along the outside border so that I would have anchors to tie the bag to my frame.

I used a binding foot to finish the raw inside edges with what I'm pretty sure is called acrylic twill tape.

And here is the complete bag!
